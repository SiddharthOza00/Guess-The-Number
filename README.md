# Guess-The-Number

This is a fun and interactive web game designed to test your intuition and logical thinking. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the game challenges players to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 20. Each round begins with 20 attempts, and for every incorrect guess, players receive feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The goal is to correctly identify the number in as few attempts as possible.

The game features a scoring system that tracks two key metrics:  
- **Current Score:** Starts at 20 and decreases with each wrong guess.  
- **High Score:** Records the best score achieved across all rounds, motivating players to continuously improve.  

The sleek, minimalist design ensures smooth gameplay, while dynamic feedback keeps players engaged. Whether you're looking for a quick challenge or aiming to break your high score, **Guess the Number** offers an entertaining experience that blends strategy with a bit of luck. Perfect for casual gamers and number enthusiasts alike, it’s a game that’s easy to pick up but hard to put down!
